# Documentation

The goal of this directory is to keep track of various ideas.

Ideally, much of the potential comments in source code are better put into documentation
    than into the source code.
    
"core" means that it uses perl standard package system.

"dynamic" means that it uses javascript-style "require"/"eval" loading method, which I wanted to be more popular while making this project.

perl packages must end in "1" by convention.
